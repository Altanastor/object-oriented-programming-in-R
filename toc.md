This book has the following chapters:

Classes and generic functions — in which we learn how to write generic functions and how generic functions are dispatched based on the class of objects using the S3 system.

Class hierarchies — in which we learn how to construct class hierarchies through inheritance.

Multiple inheritance — in which we learn how R (in the S3 system) deals with classes inheriting from more than one super-class.

Overloading operators — in which we learn how to use classes to overload operators.

S4 classes — in which we learn how to use the S4 system for object-oriented programming. The S4 system is an alternative to the S3 system that is more strict in type checking and usage.

RC classes — in which we learn how to use the RC system for object-oriented programming. The RC system is more similar to other object-oriented programming languages in that it allows mutable objects and thus really allows for object to have state that can be changed as a consequence of method calls.
