# Object-oriented programming in R

This is the source text to my book [Object-oriented programming in R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MUBRSTS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MUBRSTS&linkCode=as2&tag=wpamazify-21&linkId=e306d89a6bb8aa553022d66381ff0c98). If you want to support my writing, though, please consider buying the book at Amazon. This helps me recover the costs involved with writing and publishing books.

Proofreading before making a paperback:

- [x] Introduction
- [x] Classes and generic functions
- [x] Class hierarchies
- [x] Implementation and reuse
- [x] Operator overloading
- [x] S4 classes
- [x] R6 classes
- [x] Conclusions

Also, need to
- [x] Make time usage figure (2.1) black and white. This will require a little bit of preprocessing and ggplot hacking, I fear.
